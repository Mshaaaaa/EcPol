* Step 1: Define post-treatment period (after July 2018)
gen postt = (ym >= tm(2018m7))

* Step 2: Define treatment group (China + Tariff Affected) => already in the data as "tariff" tariff: =1 if hs_tariff=1 and china==1
gen treatment = (tariff == 1)


* Step 3: Define control group (Non-China or China not affected by tariff)
* Here, we compare China with tariffs vs China without tariffs
gen control_group = (china == 0 & hs_tariff == 0)

* Step 4: Create the interaction term for DiD (China + Tariff Affected Ã— Post-Treatment)
gen did_interaction = treatment * postt


* Step 5: Take the natural log of the price variable (to capture relative changes)
gen ln_price = ln(price)  

* Step 6: Run the Difference-in-Differences regression with log(price) as the outcome
regress ln_price postt treatment ym did_interaction wave i.coicop, robust


* Plot the trends for the treatment and control groups
